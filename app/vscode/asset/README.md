# Custom Conversations

What if you want to craft an AI Chat that knows _specifically_ about your conventions?
How cool would it be to have the answers in your own language?

You can craft your own conversation templates by adding `.rdt.md` files to the `.learnflow/template` folder in your workspace. See the [Learnflow Template docs](https://github.com/trungnt13/learnflow-vscode/blob/main/doc/learnflow-templates.md) for more information.

To use custom conversations, run the "Learnflow: Start Custom Chatâ€¦ ðŸ’¬" command.

Here is an example of a [drunken pirate describing your code](https://github.com/trungnt13/learnflow-vscode/blob/main/template/fun/drunken-pirate.rdt.md):

# Tips and Tricks

Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of Learnflow.

- **Be specific**.
  When you ask for, e.g., code changes, include concrete names and describe the desired outcome. Avoid vague references.
- **Provide context**.
  You can include the programming language ("in Rust") or other relevant contexts for basic questions.
  You can select a meaningful code snippet for code explanations and error diagnosis.
- **Do not trust answers blindly**.
  It's a big step for a learnflow agent to be able to respond to your questions.
  It might respond with inaccurate answers, especially when talking about
  less well-known topics or when the conversation gets too detailed.
- **Use different chat threads for different topics**.
  Shorter threads with specific topics will help Learnflow respond more accurately.
